# twist-optimization
Wing twist script, to make elliptical lift wing.


This is an implementation of the technique in Kevin Lane's paper from 2010.

## Usage

The current name of the base VSP model is hardcoded into the script.

When `adjust_span_stations` is `True`, your model will be written to.

# Current status

Buggy. This is an initial version which has known problems we are still investigating.
